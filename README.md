# Project Dropshot
Project Dropshot is a custom made server for the sunsetted game Uberstrike and is being developed by [@festivaldev](https://github.com/festivaldev).

## Features
- **Authentication**  
All Uberstrike accounts you create can be linked to a Steam-id. When starting the game, Uberstrike will provide the server with your Steam-id and log you in.
- **Inventory and Loadout**  
The server will save your loadout and inventory when you "buy" a new item or make changes to your loadout, so you won't lose progress when disconnecting.
- **Massive Shop Sale**  
The shop contains 99% of all items ever released in Uberstrike. Every item has no level lock, no tier and no price. You can buy all items in the shop for free.
- **Customization**  
The server relies heavily on JSON files to store it's components and data. This enables you to customize the shop (including prices, item names, available items, etc.), the maps (not the maps itself but rather their name, their available game modes, max/min player count, the thumbnail, etc.) or account data (username, rank, money, etc.).
